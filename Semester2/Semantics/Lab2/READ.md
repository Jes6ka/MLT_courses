# Cooper Storage
### Reason why we are using this is simple. In order to find "CORE".
### For example, John loves cats. We can consider Verb(love) as a core, and write this way
### Love(A, B) : A love B or Love(B,A)
### This is better way to read than A(Love(B)) or B(Love(A)) or A(B(Love)) or B(A(Love)) 
### As you noticed, there are 6 possible orders exist. Love, A and B. 3*2*1 = 6
### As we consider former "complex forms" as simple "storage", e,g. STORAGE = [some_complex_combinations_of_functions]
### we can treat STORAGE as one elements. All we need to do is just "linking to Storage"

### For example, Every cat chased John and Mery.
### In lab1, it was complex formation but now we can use in one predicate(function)
### Which is  "Chase(STORAGE1, STOARGE2)" where STORAGE1 == every cat, STORAGE2 == John and Mery.
